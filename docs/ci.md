# Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pull request and on every push to
`main`. It runs the quality gates from `.kiro/steering/workflow.md`:

| Job | Gates |
|---|---|
| Rust (fmt, clippy, test) | `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --workspace --locked` |
| Rust dependencies (cargo-deny) | `cargo deny check` (licences, advisories, bans, sources; see `deny.toml`) |
| TypeScript (Biome, typecheck, test, audit) | `pnpm biome check .`, `pnpm -r typecheck`, `pnpm -r test`, `pnpm audit` |
| Generated types are current | `node scripts/gen-types.ts --check` (ADR 0009) |
| **CI passed** | Always runs; fails unless every job above succeeded |

Run the same gates locally before pushing:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --locked
cargo deny check
pnpm biome check .
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r test
pnpm check-types
```

## Blocking merges (repository setting)

A workflow reports failures but cannot block a merge by itself. Merging is
blocked only when a ruleset on `main` requires the check. Required checks pass
on `success`, `skipped` or `neutral`, so require only **CI passed**: it runs
even when another job is skipped and fails if any job did not succeed.

This is a GitHub setting, not a file, so a repository admin sets it once:

1. Open the repository on GitHub and click **Settings**.
2. In the left sidebar, under "Code and automation", click **Rules**, then
   **Rulesets**, then **New ruleset** → **New branch ruleset**.
3. Name it `main`, set **Enforcement status** to **Active**, and under
   **Target branches** add the default branch.
4. Enable **Require a pull request before merging**.
5. Enable **Require status checks to pass before merging**, and add the check
   **CI passed** (source: GitHub Actions).
6. Enable **Block force pushes**, then **Create**.

To confirm it works, open a pull request that breaks one gate (for example an
unformatted Rust file): the **CI passed** check fails and the merge button stays
blocked.

## Workflow rules

- The workflow starts with `permissions: {}`; each job grants only
  `contents: read`.
- `actions/checkout` runs with `persist-credentials: false`; no job pushes.
- Every action, including GitHub's own, is pinned to a full commit SHA with the
  version in a trailing comment. Update the SHA and the comment together.
- Node comes from `.node-version`; pnpm comes from `packageManager` in the root
  `package.json`; Rust comes from `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- No caches: every run starts from a clean install.

## Sources

- Required status checks and rulesets:
  https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets
  and `creating-rulesets-for-a-repository` (read from github/docs `main`).
- Action inputs read from each action's `action.yml` at the pinned commit.
